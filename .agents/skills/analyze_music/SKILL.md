# Skill 1: `analyze_music`

## Purpose

Turn `arranged_music.xml` into a compact musical representation that an LLM can reason over without reading raw MusicXML.

This skill is music-analysis-only. It should not read lyrics and should not alter the score.

## Inputs

```text
arranged_music.xml
```

Optional config:

```json
{
  "preferred_vocal_range": ["C4", "A5"],
  "target_style": "gentle children's song",
  "language_hint": "English"
}
```

## Tools

### music21

Use `music21` to:

- parse MusicXML
- list parts and instruments
- extract measures, notes, rests, voices, and durations
- infer key and meter
- read tempo markings
- chordify the arrangement to infer harmonic context
- find candidate melody lines
- compute ranges and singability features

## Core responsibilities

1. Parse the score.
2. Extract global metadata: tempo, meter, key, measure count.
3. Extract part-level metadata: instrument names, ranges, density, likely role.
4. Identify melody candidates.
5. Estimate phrase boundaries.
6. Infer harmonic context, preferably as chord symbols or roman numerals.
7. Emit `music_analysis.json`.

## Output

Write `music_analysis.json` matching [the shared schema](../../../references/schemas/music_analysis.schema.json).

Example:

```json
{
  "score": {
    "tempo_bpm": 96,
    "meter": "4/4",
    "key": "C major",
    "measure_count": 16,
    "parts": [
      {
        "id": "P1",
        "name": "piano",
        "range": ["C3", "G5"],
        "role_guess": "accompaniment",
        "density_score": 0.72
      },
      {
        "id": "P2",
        "name": "flute",
        "range": ["C4", "A5"],
        "role_guess": "melody_candidate",
        "density_score": 0.31
      }
    ],
    "phrases": [
      {
        "id": "A1",
        "measures": [1, 4],
        "cadence_guess": "half cadence",
        "melody_candidate_part": "P2"
      }
    ],
    "harmony": [
      {
        "measure": 1,
        "beat": 1.0,
        "chord_guess": "I"
      }
    ],
    "melody_candidates": [
      {
        "source_part": "P2",
        "measures": [1, 8],
        "note_count": 32,
        "singability_score": 0.86,
        "range": ["C4", "G5"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "warnings": []
}
```

## Why this output is useful

The next skill needs to decide where and how to sing. It needs compact facts:

- which part probably carries the tune
- where phrases start and end
- whether the melody fits a singable range
- how many melody notes are available
- whether accompaniment conflicts with the vocal register

## Suggested CLI

Implementation: [scripts/analyze_music.py](scripts/analyze_music.py), invoked by repo-root `bin/analyze_music`.

```bash
./bin/analyze_music arranged_music.xml --out music_analysis.json
```

## Failure modes

Return a nonzero exit code and diagnostic JSON if:

- MusicXML cannot be parsed
- no usable note material is found
- lyrics are empty
- tempo cannot be determined and no default is supplied

If key, chords, or phrases are uncertain, emit warnings instead of failing.
